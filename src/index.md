    <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle">
The W3C Credentials Community Group is dedicated to creating open,
interoperable standards for verifiable credentials and decentralized
identity. We work to establish a decentralized, privacy-preserving ecosystem
where individuals and organizations can securely share and verify credentials
without compromising personal data or relying on centralized authorities.
    </p>
    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Decentralization</h3>
        <p>
We promote decentralized identity solutions that reduce reliance on
centralized authorities and single points of failure.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Privacy By Design</h3>
        <p>
Our specifications prioritize privacy and data protection, giving individuals
and organizations control over their private information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Interoperability</h3>
        <p>
We develop standards that work across different platforms, vendors, and
ecosystems, ensuring credentials can be used anywhere they're needed.
