The W3C Credentials Community Group chose a pangolin named **Privvy** as our
mascot because these remarkable creatures embody the principles of
digital privacy and digital credential security. Just as a pangolin's natural armor
plates shield it from harm, cryptographic protection safeguards our digital
credentials and personal data. When threatened, pangolins roll into a
protective ball—a metaphor for how users should have complete control
over their privacy, revealing information only when they choose to.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural armor</strong> - Their distinctive scales visually represent the layers of security and privacy that protect digital credentials</li>

            <li><strong>Rolling into a ball</strong> - Just like pangolins choose when to open up or protect themselves, users should control when and how their data is shared</li>

            <li><strong>Unique and memorable</strong> - Pangolins are rarely used as mascots and deserve more love and attention</li>

            <li><strong>Gentle but secure</strong> - These peaceful and curious creatures only defend when necessary, reflecting our approach to privacy—protective but not paranoid</li>

            <li><strong>Scales as symbols</strong> - The individual V-shaped scales represent the protection afforded by digital credentials and the process of verifiability</li>

            <li><strong>Name play</strong> - "Privvy" combines "privy" (having access to confidential information) with "privacy" (part of our core mission)</li>
