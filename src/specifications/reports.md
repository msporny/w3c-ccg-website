    <p>
Work items that have successfully completed incubation in the W3C
Credentials Community Group and have either moved to the standards track at
global standardization organizations or provide stable guidance that has
reached a mature status.

    <p class="section-subtitle">
Final Reports represent the successful completion of the Community Group's
incubation process. These work items have matured through community
collaboration, implementation testing, and may have transitioned to formal
standardization or achieved stable status as community guidance.

        <p>
Work items that have been successfully transferred to global standards
organizations such as W3C Working Groups, IETF Working Groups, or other
recognized standards bodies for formal standardization.

        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>Initial Concept</h3>
        <p>
New ideas and use cases are identified by community members and discussed
in weekly meetings. Initial problem statements and requirements are
documented to guide development.

      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-flask"></i>Community Incubation</h3>
        <p>
Specifications are developed collaboratively within the Community Group,
with regular feedback, iteration, and refinement based on implementation
experience and community input.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i>Implementation Testing</h3>
        <p>
Multiple independent implementations are built to validate the
specification's feasibility, identify edge cases, and ensure
interoperability across different platforms and vendors.

      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>Maturity Assessment</h3>
        <p>
The Community Group evaluates whether the work item is ready for standards
track transition or has achieved sufficient stability to serve as community
guidance.

      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i>Standards Track or Stable Status</h3>
        <p>
Work items either transition to appropriate standards organizations for
formal standardization or are designated as stable community guidance with
ongoing maintenance.

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i>Final Report Publication</h3>
