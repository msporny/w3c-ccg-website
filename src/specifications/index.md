The W3C Credentials Community Group incubates specifications that eventually
progress to the standards track at W3C, IETF, or other global standards
bodies. The work that is now a global standard was originally incubated in
the Credentials Community Group, while other work is currently being
incubated here for future standardization.

          <a href="{{basedir}}/specifications/standards/">Global Standards</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
Official standards published by W3C, IETF, and other global standards
bodies. These specifications were originally incubated by the W3C
Credentials Community Group and have now become stable, production-ready
standards used worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
These include the Verifiable Credentials family of
specifications, Decentralized Identifiers, and related cryptographic and
transport standards that provide the foundation for interoperable verifiable
credential systems.

        <p>
Emerging specifications currently being developed and tested by the W3C
Credentials Community Group. These specifications extend and enhance
verifiable credentials capabilities and represent the next generation of
digital credential technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
This incubation work includes advanced cryptographic techniques,
privacy-preserving technologies, new credential formats, API
specifications, and industry-specific extensions that may become future
global standards.

    <h2 class="section-title">The Incubation to Standards Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
<strong>Community Incubation</strong> - New ideas and specifications begin
in the W3C Credentials Community Group where they are developed, tested,
and refined
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Implementation and Testing</strong> - Community members build
implementations and conduct interoperability testing to validate the
technical approach
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Standards Track Proposal</strong> - Well incubated specifications are
proposed to appropriate standards bodies like W3C Working Groups or IETF
Working Groups
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Formal Standardization</strong> - Specifications undergo the formal
standards process, including wide review, implementation reports, and final
approval
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Global Deployment</strong> - Completed standards are deployed
worldwide, providing stable foundations for production systems
      </li>
