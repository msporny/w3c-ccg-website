    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Create Credentials</strong> - Issue verifiable credentials with
different data models and see how they're structured according to W3C
standards
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Try Different Signatures</strong> - Experiment with various
cryptographic signature methods including EdDSA, ECDSA, and JWT-based
approaches
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Verify Presentations</strong> - Test the verification process for
verifiable presentations and understand how claims are validated
      </li>
